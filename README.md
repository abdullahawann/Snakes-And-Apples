# Snakes-And-Apples
Snakes and Apples" is a simple yet addictive game implemented in assembly language. The objective of the game is to control a snake on the screen and guide it to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or its own tail.

The snake moves continuously in a specified direction, and the player can change the direction using arrow keys or other designated controls. Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer, increasing the challenge of navigating without self-intersection.

The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each apple consumed. As the snake grows, the gameplay becomes more challenging, requiring careful maneuvering and quick reflexes to avoid collisions.

This assembly language implementation of "Snakes and Apples" offers a nostalgic gaming experience while also serving as an educational resource for those interested in low-level programming and game development.
